# ProbAI 2021

I had a chance to attend 2021 edition of [ProbAI summer school](https://probabilistic.ai/) organized by NTNU.

This folder contains  notebooks of daily tutorial and assignement of summer school. The orginal repository with all notebook is available
at ProbAI's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/probabilisticai/probai-2021). 

The tutorial uses [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the base diffrential programming framework and [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/) as the probabislitc programming language.
